STL--> Standard Template Library
Library of what?
-->Generic classes and functions

Why we use STL?
1.reuse: well tested components
2. Time savings!
3. STL is used becuse it is a good idea not to reinvent the wheel

Components of STL-->:
1. Containers-->the object which stores data 
- use template classes
2. Algorithms
- [sorting]
- [searching]
- [use template functions]
3. Iterators
--> object that points to an element in a container
--> handles just like pointers
--> connects algorithms with containers 


Example::
[1,3,5,11...]
iterator moves as instructed by the algorithms
